Thanks to Sam Henri Gold for publicly documenting and demonstrating the MacBook lid-angle sensor in [LidAngleSensor](https://github.com/samhenrigold/LidAngleSensor), published under Apache License 2.0.

Macbook Duo's reader was written for this project. Its device identifiers (Sensor page 0x20, Orientation usage 0x8A), feature-report ID 1, and two-byte little-endian degree value were verified against that project and against this M4 MacBook Pro's hardware. No audio or other assets from that project are included.

The original five effects and controls were developed for Macbook Duo. Ghost’s later projection study and adaptation are credited below. Bendy and the public demonstrations by Adrian Abelarde and Seb Vidal are visual and architectural references, not dependencies. This project is not affiliated with those developers or Apple.

## Effect study for 0.1.2

The user's supplied Bendy demonstration video was studied alongside [FrostFold](https://github.com/askmaddyy/FrostFold/tree/a9af51a5565b7d75525c7aab84f2add96d0669ae) (MIT) and [iphone-solo](https://github.com/soloiaros/iphone-solo/tree/752764bdf68ca16d55b65c76738c23d4266b1137) (no license file present in the studied tree). They informed the discussion of stationary content, tilted glass, and multiscale defocus. Their source, graphics, and videos are not bundled in the app or the source distribution. The shipped Metal implementation is original, with a bottom-anchored expansion and a binomial blur pyramid, developed after an independent Claude Opus 5 review.

These projects are independent recreations. They do not establish how Apple implemented its animation. Macbook Duo aims for its own responsive visual treatment rather than a claim of pixel-identical reproduction.

## Ghost resting-plane study for 0.1.12

Thanks to [Ansh Varshney’s Macbook-duo demonstration](https://github.com/anshvarshney1502/Macbook-duo) and the upstream [Lid Plane by Jhey](https://github.com/jh3y/lid-plane) for clarifying the stationary-viewer projection: a moving panel samples a desktop plane anchored at the last resting angle. Macbook-duo distributes a packaged app; the readable implementation is in its upstream project. No reference binaries, videos or artwork are included.

Ghost applies that geometric approach with Macbook Duo’s existing blur pyramid, separate physical-angle state, gradual onset and shared animated clearing. The upstream MIT notice is retained below for the projection study and adaptation.
